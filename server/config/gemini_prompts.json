Compare the generated face to the references, focusing on these features: overall face shape, eye color and shape, eyebrow shape and thickness, nose shape and size, lip shape and fullness, jawline definition, chin shape, overall facial proportions, and apparent skin tone. Clearly describe the similarities and differences found for each feature category where possible. Conclude with an assessment of how well the generated face matches the reference(s).",

Compare the generated body to the references, focusing on these features: hair style and color, overall body size and build (e.g., thin, average, muscular, heavy), body proportions (e.g., limb length relative to torso), apparent number of limbs, posture (if clearly discernible), and any highly distinct characteristics visible (e.g., significant muscle definition, pregnancy, visible disabilities affecting structure). Ignore clothing details unless they directly reveal body shape or features mentioned above. Clearly describe the similarities and differences found for each relevant feature category. Conclude with an assessment of how well the generated body matches the reference(s)."
